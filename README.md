# WorkflowAssignment
# This is a project developed for the goal of becoming familiar with how to create and use R Projects. 
# In the project, there is a file (dessertDat.Rmd) that shows how a data set (containing favorite desserts (favDessert), ranking (dessertRanking) and how many would be ideal to eat (quantity)) was created and made into a dataset. 
# In the file titled, "dessert data.Rmd" there are a few lines of code that open a table of the data to be viewed, a summary of the columns, a call to find the mean of one of the columns to make sure it was working fine. The following line gives summary statistics for the table, and the line after that attempts to graph this information, however the last time I ran it it did not produce a graph and I'm not sure why.
